# US-Visa-Approval
- Developed a US Visa Approval system using Machine Learning and MongoDB, increasing the approval chances.
- Created a web application using Python and hosted using AWS, so that applicants can interact easily and imporove their chances of approval.
- Used MLOps tool - Evidently.ai to detect data drift & various Machine Learning algorithm to develop the best model.


<!-- - Given a set of features (continents, education, job experience, training, employment, age etc)
- We have to predict weather the application for the visa will be approved or not. -->

## Solution scope
This can be used on real life by US Visa applicants, so that they can improve their resume and criteria for the approval process.

## Solution proposed
1. Load data from DB
2. Perform EDA and feature engineering to select desirable features.
3. Fit ML classification algorithm and find out which one perform better.
4. Select top few and tune hyperparameter.
5. Select the best model based on desired metrics.

## MLOps Tool - Evidently ai

## Workflow:

1. constants
2. entity
3. components
4. pipeline
5. Main file
